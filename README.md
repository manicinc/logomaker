Logomaker is a free, open-source, client-side text logo generator featuring ~400 fonts, dynamic effects, and versatile export options. Designed for **extreme portability** and **offline-first use**, it leverages an optimized build process with intelligent font loading, that allows for users to easily import and manage their own fonts.

This project is more than just a tool; it's a **Human+AI collaborative coding experiment** developed by [Manic Agency](https://manic.agency). Roughly 90% of the codebase originated from AI (LLMs like GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini families) guided by **technical prompt engineering** and refined through an **iterative collaborative development and testing process**, or **‚ú® Vibe Coding ‚ú®** ‚Äì an attempt to harness AI for rapid development while maintaining robust engineering practices and a distinct creative workflow. It's a practical look at the potential and challenges of this emerging development paradigm, built by an agency focused on experimental tech (AR/VR, AI/ML, GenAI, Crypto, Game Design).

See the [Technical Deep Dive (coming soon)](https://manic.agency/blog) for more insights into the process and structure.

## ‚ú® Features Overview

* **üî§ BYOF Font Library with defaults:** ~400 fonts available. Dynamically loaded online (chunked w/ IndexedDB caching) or fully embedded offline, with font licensing support. See [fontmanager.md](./docs/fontmanager.md).
* **üé¨ Full Vector Animation Support:** Apply subtle animations (Pulse, Bounce, Glitch, etc.). Control speed. Included directly in SVG exports via CSS!
* **üì¶ Pro Export Options:**
    * **SVG:** Clean, scalable vectors. Embeds fonts (via `@font-face` data URLs) & CSS animations. Ideal for web/editing.
    * **PNG:** High-quality raster images with optional transparency. Control resolution and quality.
    * **Frames (ZIP):** Animation sequence as individual PNG frames + HTML preview.
* **üîó Shareable URLs:** Generate unique links capturing your exact design state.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Choose the version that best suits your needs:

**1. Live Demo (Online - Optimized Build)** ‚ö°

The fastest way to get started. Experience the web-optimized version with dynamic font loading.

‚û°Ô∏è **[Try Logomaker Online Now!](https://manicinc.github.io/logomaker/)**
* Uses the optimized build (`dist/github-pages`).
* Loads a small font index (~100KB) initially, then fetches font data chunks (`*.json`) on demand.

**2. Portable Version (Offline - Single File or Folder)** üì¶

Ideal for offline environments, workshops, or easy sharing.

* **Build it first:** Run `node scripts/build.js` or `node scripts/build.js --target=portable` locally (see instructions below).
* **Single File:** If `dist/portable/logomaker-portable.html` exists (requires the `portapack` dev dependency: `npm install -D portapack`), open this single file in any modern browser. All assets, including fonts (Base64 encoded), are embedded.
* *Note:* Expect a **significantly slower initial load** compared to the optimized version due to the large (~90-100MB) embedded font data.

## Background 

From conception, this was designed as a lightweight application with no online or external dependencies required for functionality (some online libraries are optionally enabled for QR code and one PNG exporting option). Thus, this can also easily be built into native desktop / mobile experiences with Electron, Ionic, etc.

Imagine having your own offline designing / editing app that never needs updating or will ever break,m and embeds a full extendable font library with virtually unlimited font support from lazy loading. That was a straightforward enough vision to keep everything lightweight (save for the font media assets).

Thus, we have no `package.json` file, and keep things simple with a singular HTML entrypoint `index.html`, and your standard static assets in `css/` and `js/`. We also store fonts in `fonts/` in LFS, though we have a multitude of building and font loading options to allow for Logomaker to be run as both an offline HTML file without a server, or through a server with more optimal assets serving.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)

### Usage

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/manicinc/logomaker.git](https://github.com/manicinc/logomaker.git)
cd logomaker

# 2. Pull Git LFS files (the fonts)
git lfs pull

# 3. Install development dependencies (http-server, chokidar)
npm install

# 4. Run Development Server (Watch, Build, Serve @ http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev
# (Edit code, save, then manually refresh browser)
# (Press Ctrl+C to stop)

# 5. Run Production Preview (Build, Serve @ http://localhost:3001 - No Watch)
npm run preview
# (Press Ctrl+C to stop)

# 6. Manual Builds (Output to ./dist/ folder)
npm run build          # Build deploy target (default) -> ./dist/github-pages/
npm run build:deploy   # Build deploy target -> ./dist/github-pages/
npm run build:portable # Build portable target -> ./dist/portable/ (directory)
```

See [development.md](./docs/development.md) for more info on development mode.

### üõ†Ô∏è Building the Project

Logomaker offers two build targets: a web-optimized version with chunked font loading and a fully portable offline build. The project uses a lightweight build process with no external dependencies, allowing for easy deployment across different environments. Simply run `node scripts/build.js` to generate the default web version, or use `node scripts/build.js --target=portable` for an offline, single-file application. For detailed build instructions and advanced configuration, check out our [comprehensive build documentation](docs/build.md).

## ü§î Performance & Loading: Optimized vs. Portable

Logomaker employs distinct loading strategies tailored for different use cases:

* **Optimized Version (`dist/github-pages` / Live Demo):**
    * **Mechanism:** Uses **Font Chunking**. `fontManager.js` loads a small `index.json` (~100KB) containing font metadata. When a font is needed, its specific data chunk (`a-f.json`, `g-m.json`, etc.) is fetched from the `./font-chunks/` directory. Downloaded chunks are cached in **IndexedDB** for persistence. `@font-face` rules are injected dynamically.
    * **Pros:** ‚úÖ **Fast initial load** online. ‚úÖ Efficient bandwidth usage (only load needed fonts). ‚úÖ Persistent caching via IndexedDB.
    * **Cons:** Requires a web server. Needs an internet connection for uncached fonts.
* **Portable Version (`dist/portable`):**
    * **Mechanism:** **Embeds all font data** (Base64 encoded, ~90-100MB+) directly into `inline-fonts-data.js` or bundles everything into a single HTML file using `portapack`. `fontManager.js` detects this embedded data (`window._INLINE_FONTS_DATA`) and uses it directly.
    * **Pros:** ‚úÖ Works **completely offline** from anywhere (web server, `file:///`). ‚úÖ Single file option for ultimate portability.
    * **Cons:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Very slow initial load** and high memory usage due to the large embedded data blob.

**The build script (`node scripts/build.js`) handles the complexities of generating both modes.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Deep Dive: The "Vibe Coding" Experiment

Logomaker's development was a deliberate exploration of **Human+AI Collaborative Coding**, termed "Vibe Coding".

* **Process:** Involved defining requirements and architecture, then using **technically-guided prompt engineering** with LLMs to generate initial code structures, functions, and UI elements. This was followed by rigorous **human testing, debugging, refactoring, and integration**. No significant function was purely hand-written; AI provided the initial drafts or suggestions, which were then iteratively refined.
* **Goal:** To investigate if this collaborative "vibe" could accelerate development while producing a reasonably complex, functional application. It highlights the strengths of AI in boilerplate generation and exploring implementation options, alongside the indispensable role of human expertise in architecture, validation, and ensuring robustness.
* **Architecture:** See [**architecture.md**](./docs/architecture.md) for a breakdown of components, the rendering flow, and more on the Human+AI model.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Future Ideas

* **CSS ‚û°Ô∏è Export Fidelity:** Complex CSS effects (especially advanced filters, masks, intricate backgrounds/borders) may render differently or be simplified in SVG/PNG exports compared to the live browser preview.
* **Animation Export:** Generating many PNG frames (>50-100) for the ZIP export can be slow and memory-intensive in the browser.
* **Future Polish:** More robust font weight/style validation, better text overflow handling, additional effects/animations/patterns, improved theming capabilities.
* **Electron App:** Wrapping the application for native desktop use remains a potential future enhancement.
* **QR Codes:** Requires manually uncommenting and including an external library (`davidshimjs-qrcodejs`) in `index.html` for the Share URL modal QR code functionality.
